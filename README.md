# LSTM-vs-Distill-Bert
 This project aimed for testing the performance of LSTM and Transformers(Keeping in view of computation capacity, we used Distill Bert). Another reason was due to accuracy issues. 
 Our goal on each model was to have an accuracy of at least 60% on testing data.

 # About the Dataset
 The dataset was of English and Slovenian with any sort of information that contained 8 types of tags
